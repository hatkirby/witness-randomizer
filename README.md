# The Witness Tutorialiser Mod

This mod replaces most puzzles in the game with Tutorial Straight (the first puzzle in the tunnel where you start the game). Certain special panels are unaffected. Additionally, some panels (e.g. the tutorial gate, and every puzzle in Bunker) behave a little strangely now, and can be solved by simply double clicking in the middle of the panel.

## Is everything in the game still possible?

As of version 0.2.0, all 523 counting panels can be solved. This may require some creativity on your part, as certain controls (e.g. everything that moves in Quarry) no longer function.

The following environmental puzzles are impossible in this mod:

* Mill Ramp Light EP
* Mill Lift Light EP
* Quarry Elevator EP
* Boathouse Front Ramp EP
* Boathouse Back Ramp EP
* Swamp Underwater Sliding Bridge EP
* Swamp Purple Sand Outward EP
* Swamp Purple Sand Middle EP
* Swamp Purple Sand Inward EP is a special case. This puzzle is solveable at the start of the game, but can become impossible depending on your actions. The Swamp Floodgate can only be closed in this mod, so if you want to solve this EP you must do it before solving the floodgate.
* Swamp Floodgate EP
